   About ops2m
---===========---

All OPS2M demo discs contain an encrypted config file that determines how the
demo's GUI looks like (menus, colors, selectable games/videos etc.) and how the
playable games are started (path to ELF, IOP image to use, play time etc.). The
config file is named SCEE_DD/CONFIG.TXT or SCEE_DD/CONFIG.DD2 (older demos).

You can use ops2m to decrypt/modify/encrypt those config files.


---==---
   Build
---=====---

To build ops2m, simply run:
$ make

Of course, you can also install it:
$ make install

CMake is supported too:
$ mkdir build
$ cd build/
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ make install


---==---
   Usage
---=====---

usage: ops2m <input file> <output file> [-d|-e]

This will decrypt or encrypt the config file <input file> to <output file> using
the new scheme (file SCEE_DD/CONFIG.TXT, symmetric cipher).

options:
-d decrypt using old scheme (file SCEE_DD/CONFIG.DD2)
-e encrypt using old scheme (file SCEE_DD/CONFIG.DD2)
